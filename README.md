# A tiny blog written in Sinatra

You can see the progress [here](https://obscure-reef-2940.herokuapp.com/)

Here are the features I want:
* Clean, simple, design. Declutterd
* No DB. Simple text files as the 'backend' so I can push stuff with git and use vim
* Separate "published" from "staged" posts.
* "Staged" posts should only be reachable behind auth
* Password protect individual posts
* No admin UI. Any config necessary should be in text
* Individual header image if needed
* provide a proper 404 page

* On the text:
** Markdown and syntax hightlighting
** Have a way to merge lines that form a paragraph. Its annoying in MD
** Have a way to highlight qutoes
