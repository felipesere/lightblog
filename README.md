# A tiny blog written in Sinatra

Here are the features I want:
* Clean, simple, design. Declutterd
* No DB. Simple text files as the 'backend' so I can push stuff with git and use vim
* Separate "published" from "staged" posts.
* "Staged" posts should only be reachable behind auth
* Password protect individual posts
* Have a way to merge lines that form a paragraph. Its annoying in MD
* No admin UI. Any config necessary should be in text
* Markdown and syntax hightlighting
