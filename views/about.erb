      <p>My name is Felipe Ser√© and you have just landed on my site! On this site I publish pictures that were
  taken during most of my vacations or places I have been to. Such places include Kenya, Uruguay,
  Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands. I picked up photography while living in Kenya with my parents
  about twelve years ago. Over the years I have learned to use both my beloved 70-200mm tele and my trusty
  10-22mm wide angle lens. My current challenge is to use a 50mm fixed-lens more and more.

  The style of image I am aiming at is colourful and cheerful. I like to either pick out minute details or
  show large landscapes.</p>
